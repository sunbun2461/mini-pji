Apologies for the confusion. Here's the same guide in Markdown format:

## Setting up Development Workflow with MacBook, CentOS Server, and GitHub

### 1. Setting up the Remote Repository on GitHub
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.
- Name the repository and choose any desired settings (e.g., public or private).
- Once created, note down the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`).

### 2. Cloning the Remote Repository to your MacBook
- Open Terminal on your MacBook.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
- Run the following command to clone the remote repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  ```

### 3. Initializing a Git Repository on the CentOS Server
- Connect to your CentOS server via SSH.
- Navigate to the desired directory where you want to store your project.
- Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
  ```
  git init
  ```

### 4. Configuring Git on the CentOS Server
- Set your name and email for Git commits on the CentOS server using the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
  ```

### 5. Adding the Remote Repository to the CentOS Server
- Go back to your MacBook.
- Retrieve the SSH URL of your remote repository on GitHub (e.g., `git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git`).
- On the CentOS server, run the following command inside your project directory to add the remote repository:
  ```
  git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
  ```

### 6. Pushing Changes from MacBook to the Remote Repository
- Make changes to your code on your MacBook.
- Stage and commit your changes using Git commands (e.g., `git add .` and `git commit -m "Commit message"`).
- Push the changes to the remote repository using the following command:
  ```
  git push origin main
  ```

### 7. Pulling Changes to the CentOS Server
- On the CentOS server, navigate to your project directory.
- Run the following command to pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```

### 8. Deployment to Production
- Once the changes are tested and ready to go live, follow your deployment process to move the code from the CentOS server to your production environment.
- This may involve copying the files to the appropriate directory on the CentOS server or using deployment tools specific to your setup.

Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name in the commands.

By following these steps, you'll have a development workflow where you can make changes on your MacBook, push them to the remote repository on GitHub, and then pull those changes to your CentOS server for testing or deployment to production.
