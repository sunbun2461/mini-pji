# Perl/Catalyst/Template Toolkit Web App with Database

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the steps to create a small web application using Perl, Catalyst, and Template Toolkit with a database backend.

## Prerequisites
- Perl installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Perl, Catalyst, and Template Toolkit
- MySQL database server installed and running

## Steps

1. Create a new Catalyst project:
    ```bash
    catalyst.pl MyApp
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MyApp
    ```

3. Install required Perl modules:
    ```bash
    cpanm Catalyst::Devel
    cpanm DBD::mysql
    cpanm Template
    ```

4. Configure the database connection:
   - Open `MyApp/lib/MyApp/Model/DB.pm` and modify the following lines:
     ```perl
     __PACKAGE__->config(
         ...
         dsn      => 'dbi:mysql:myapp',
         user     => 'db_user',
         password => 'db_password',
         ...
     );
     ```

5. Create the MySQL database:
   - Open a MySQL command-line client:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Create the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE myapp;
     ```

6. Create a Catalyst database migration script:
    ```bash
    script/myapp_create.pl model DB DBIC::Schema MyApp::Schema create=static dbi:mysql:myapp db_user db_password
    ```

7. Start the Catalyst development server:
    ```bash
    script/myapp_server.pl -r
    ```

8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

## Additional Comments

- Make sure to replace `MyApp` with your desired application name throughout the instructions.
- Modify the database connection details (`dsn`, `user`, `password`) to match your MySQL configuration.
- Feel free to customize the application as per your requirements by adding controllers, views, and templates.
- Use the Catalyst development server (`script/myapp_server.pl`) for development purposes only. For production, consider deploying your application with a proper web server like Apache or Nginx.
